# Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTM-and-GloVe-Embeddings
Sentiment Analysis has emerged as an important tool for many Organizations and Companies as it gives useful insights into the customer base of a website which in turn helps their decision-making process.

I deployed this model using **Streamlit**.
