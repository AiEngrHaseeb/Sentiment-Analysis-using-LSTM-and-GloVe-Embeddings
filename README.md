# Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTM-and-GloVe-Embeddings
Sentiment Analysis has emerged as an important tool for many Organizations and Companies as it gives useful insights into the customer base of a website which in turn helps their decision-making process. I will use the famous IMDb Movie Review Dataset with 50k movie reviews labeled as **‘positive’** or **‘negative’** to implement a simple Sentiment Analysis model using **LSTM** and **GloVe** Word Embeddings.
I deployed this model using **Streamlit**.
